Features
-----------------
Photon Mapping [PHOTON_MAPPING MAX_PHOTON]
Reflection and glossy reflection [Material - reflectivety glossiness]
Refraction (photon mapping only)[Material refraction refraction_index]
Soft Shadow (buildin in photon_mapping, implemented in raytracer) [SOFT_SHADOW_RANGE]
Focus point/plane [FOCUS FOCUS_INDEX]
Constructive Solid Geometry [Material negative_space]
Extra primitives (cylinder and cone)
Volume Scattering (smoke effect)
Texture Mapping (spherical gr_texture('filename') to set texture, :set_texture() to assign texture)

How to set values?
--------------------
[Overall]
In A4.cpp
GLOSSY_INDEX -- number of reflection rays
SOFT_SHADOW_RANGE -- control how soft the shadow is
TIME_OF_REFLECTION -- how many times the reflection ray bounce between reflective surface
MAX_PHOTON -- the amount of photons each light source emit
SEARCH_RANGE -- the range of searching photons
SEARCH_NUM -- capacity of searched photons each time when you call irradiance_estimate()
FOCUS -- distance between eye and focus point
Ray_TRACER -- switch for ray tracer 1-on 0-off
PHOTON_MAPPING -- switch for photon_mapping 1-on 0-off
FOCUS_INDEX -- number of focus rays


[Material]
kd, ks, shininess,    (these for ray tracer)
reflectivity,    (between 0 and 1, control the contribution of reflected colour)
refraction,   (between 0 and 1, control contribution of refraced colour, [photon mapping only])
refraction_index,   (the physical refraction index, only between material and air)
glossiness, (control the glossiness of reflection)
pd, ps,    (pd<ps<1 control diffusive reflection, specular reflection and absorption when photons hit)
volume_scattering,   (0 - off, 1 - on, control the smoke effect of the primitive)
negative_space (for constructive solid geometry)


Extra:
